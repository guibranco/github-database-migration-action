The username to connect in the MySQL/MariaDB host.
* `MYSQL_DATABASE` (required)

1. Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
3. Run `npm run local` to execute the action locally

## Example

```yml

name: "test"
on:
  pull_request:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

  jobs:
    test:
      runs-on: ubuntu-latest
      steps:

        uses: guibranco/github-mysql-migration-action@latest
        env:
